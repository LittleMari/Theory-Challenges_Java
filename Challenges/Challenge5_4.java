/*
Generate a random number between 1 and 7. Create a function that returns the day of the week in letter (corresponding 1 to Monday and 7 to Sunday).

Show on screen: Today is 5 corresponding to Friday.

To make it easier, create an array with the names of the days of the week: Monday, Tuesdayâ€¦

Once you have the number from 1 to 7, pick from the array the right day of the week.
