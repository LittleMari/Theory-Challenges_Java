/*
a) In our "programming" project,create a new Java file (class) called “Challenge1_1.java”. 
Make the IDE to locate the file in the same folder “com.daw.programming”. 
Make the program to write the message “Hello, my name is Joaquín” (replace by your name).
Hint: to make things simpler, look for the file type “Java Main Class”.

b) Write in other line “I am starting to program”.
